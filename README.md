# 🧠 Day 15 — Handwritten Digit Recognition using Deep Learning

This project focuses on recognizing handwritten digits (0–9) using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the **MNIST dataset**.  
It’s a foundational deep learning project that demonstrates how neural networks learn visual patterns from raw pixel data.

---

## 🚀 Overview
- Built a **CNN model** using TensorFlow and Keras  
- Trained on **60,000 handwritten digits** and tested on 10,000 unseen samples  
- Achieved **98%+ accuracy** in just 3 epochs  
- Visualized model performance and predictions using Matplotlib  

---

## 🧠 Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing** — Load and normalize MNIST grayscale images  
2. **Model Design** — Construct a 2-layer CNN with ReLU and Softmax activations  
3. **Training & Validation** — Fit the model and monitor performance  
4. **Evaluation & Visualization** — Test accuracy and visualize sample predictions

## 💡 Results
| Metric | Value |
|---------|--------|
| Test Accuracy | 0.98 |
| Test Loss | 0.04 |

📊 Visual results were saved as:
